TSAL is a C++ wrapper for OpenAL fixing it's many issues, adding an additional
level of abstraction and bundling ogg file support.

To build for Linux just run:

	make
	
To cross-compile using MinGW run:

	make win32
	
You might need to modify the makefile and if you want to build on a 64bit
Linux you need to substitute 64bit versions of the static libraries that are
being linked (ogg, vorbis and vorbisfile).

Directories:

./deps				Contains the libraries that are statically linked into the binary
./inc					Library API headers
./lib					Contains the TSAL library in binary form
./src					The source files for TSAL

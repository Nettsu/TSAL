To build for 32bit Linux just run:

	make
	
To build for 64bit Linux:

	make ARCH=64
	
To compile using MinGW run:

	make win32
	
You might need to modify the makefile when compiling with MinGW but then you
should be able to cross-compile just fine.

Directories:

./dep			Contains the libraries that are statically linked
./inc			Library API headers
./src			The source files for TSAL

TSAL is a C++ wrapper for OpenAL attempting to fix it's many issues, adding an 
additional level of abstraction and bundling ogg file support.

To build for 32bit Linux just run:

	make
	
To build for 64bit Linux:

	make ARCH=64
	
To compile using MinGW run:

	make win32
	
You might need to modify the makefile when compiling with MinGW but then you
should be able to cross-compile just fine.

Directories:

./dep         Contains the libraries that are statically linked
./inc         Library API headers
./src         The source files for TSAL
./examples    Contains sources and a makefile for simple examples

TSAL is a C++ wrapper for OpenAL attempting to fix it's many issues, adding an 
additional level of abstraction and bundling ogg file support.

To build for 32bit Linux just run:

	make
	
To build for 64bit Linux:

	make ARCH=64
	
To compile using MinGW run:

	make win32
	
You might need to modify the makefile when compiling with MinGW but then you
should be able to cross-compile just fine. If you want to build on a 64bit
Linux you need to substitute 64bit versions of the static libraries that are
being linked (openal, ogg, vorbis and vorbisfile) into the dep/linux64 
directory.

Directories:

./dep			Contains the libraries that are statically linked
./inc			Library API headers
./lib			Contains the TSAL library in binary form
./src			The source files for TSAL
